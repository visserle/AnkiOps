description: Add semantic quality findings to AI Notes for tutorial notes.
model: default
instructions: |
  Review each note for ambiguity, factual inconsistency, missing context, and weak
  question-answer alignment.
  If there are no high-confidence issues, leave AI Notes unchanged.
  Write findings in AI Notes as bullet points only.
  Use this exact bullet format: "- [Category] Finding. Suggestion."
  Categories: Ambiguity, Factual, Context, Alignment.
  Keep each bullet concise and avoid rewriting card content or style.
